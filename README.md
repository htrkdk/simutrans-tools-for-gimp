# simutrans-tools-for-gimp
GIMP3.0 tools for Simutrans add-on making

## Requirements

- GIMP 3.0 or newer

## Usage

Clone this repository or download the script to appropriate directory. Examples:

- Linux: `~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/simutrans-tools-for-gimp/simutrans-tools-for-gimp.py`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins\simutrans-tools-for-gimp\simutrans-tools-for-gimp.py`

## Known Issues

- After color selection, GIMP reports leakage of GEGL buffer.
- I don't have any plan to reimplement some multi-layer operations since GIMP officially supports them.
